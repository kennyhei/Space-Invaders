# Space Invaders

Space Invaders is a classic two-dimensional shooter game made by Tomohiro Nishikado in 1978.
This is my version of the game for a software project course.

You are controlling a space ship which can shoot missiles and your goal is to
destroy alien invaders before they get too close. Unfortunately invaders won't
give up without a fight as they can shoot missiles also!
If you succeed to destroy all alien invaders, a new level shall begin.
Every time you get to the next level, the invaders become faster and deadlier.
The more invaders you destroy, the more points you get.

Play it on [Heroku](https://arcane-crag-52898.herokuapp.com).
Alternatively you can clone or download this repository and open `index.html` file.
