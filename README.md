# Space Invaders

Space Invaders is a classic two-dimensional shooter game made by Tomohiro Nishikado in 1978.
This is my version of the game for a software project.

You are controlling a space ship which can shoot missiles and your goal is to
destroy alien invaders before they get too close. Unfortunately invaders won't
give up without a fight as they can shoot missiles also!
If you succeed to destroy all alien invaders, a new level shall begin but there's a little twist:
every time you get to the next level, invaders are faster and deadlier!
The more invaders you destroy, the more points you get.
